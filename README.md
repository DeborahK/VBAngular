Experiment: Let's try to create an Angular frontend with an ASP.NET Core/EF Core Backend...in Visual Basic!

# Prerequisites
* Check, if you have installed (or installed the latest version) of npm:

```
C:\Users\klauslo>npm --version
5.6.0
```
* If not, install the LTS version from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* After that, install the Angular-CLI with

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
